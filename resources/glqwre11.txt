QWRE v1.1 - Feb 15, 2000


Thanks for being patient. This much-awaited update of QWRE includes
radar transparency, display of static entities like sentry guns and
traps, adjustable size/range and proximity alarm.

Thanks to ackmed for giving me permission to include the fabulous
Gotwalls autoaim in QWRE.

Everything related to Gotwalls should work the same way: autoaim,
bsphack and fullbright. The only exception is that cl_speed has been
removed, use cl_accel instead (values are different).


Installation instructions
*************************

The zip contains QWRE11.EXE which is meant to replace your current QWCL.EXE.
Just unzip in your Quake directory and change the QuakeWorld command line
accordingly in the first GameSpy menu --> "Games and Filters".

Or, if you don't want to mess with GameSpy settings, you can also rename
QWRE11.EXE to QWCL.EXE, just make sure you make a backup of your current
QWCL.EXE first.

That's it.

Player Reference Manual
***********************

Please refer to the original Gotwalls readme (GOTWALLS.TXT) on how to use the
autoaim.

--------------------------------------------------

+showradar / -showradar               default: off

	Turns the radar on/off. This one works like +showscores or +mlook, and you
	bind it to a key as follows:

	bind W +showradar

	then the radar will be on whenever you press 'W' and go away when you
	release the key. Or you can type +showradar at the console to make it
	permanent. Default is off.

--------------------------------------------------

cl_accel  0 to 600                    default: 100

	Controls your speed, default is 100% which is normal speed.
	Set it 0 and you won't be able to move and just stand there.
	If you do that at the end of a rocket jump, just just hang in
	the air, quite fun.

--------------------------------------------------

rd_size  50 to 400                    default: 100

	Controls the radar size, in pixels. The optimal size depends on your screen resolution
	and how fast your computer is, since a larger radar will eat more fps. The recommended
	minimum screen resolution is 400x300 in software mode.

--------------------------------------------------

rd_range  0 to 5000                  default: 4000

	Controls the range of the radar, in map units. 5000 is approximately the distance between
	the two forts in 2fort5.

--------------------------------------------------

rd_transparency	 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4      default: 2

	Controls the radar transparency, allowing you to see through the radar screen

		0 is all black (not transparent)
		4 is completely transparent

	Note: using the semi-transparent modes 1, 2 and 3 might lower your fps, depending on
	how fast your computer is.

--------------------------------------------------

rd_showall	0 or 1                      default: 1

	Show all players on the radar screen if set to 1, or only the enemies.

--------------------------------------------------
rd_showsg  0 or 1                       default: 1

	Show the sentry guns if set to 1

--------------------------------------------------

rd_showtraps  0 or 1                    default: 0

	Show the "dropX" traps from MegaTF if set to 1
	Includes spikes, caltrops, proxygren, lavapool, needle, flash mine, mag mine
	and even pipe bombs

--------------------------------------------------

rd_proxyalarm  0 to 5000                default: 0

	Proximity alarm: will play a sound whenever an enemy comes within a certain distance.
	To activate the alarm, set the value to the desired distance. Set the value to 0 to
	disable. A good value is half the range.
